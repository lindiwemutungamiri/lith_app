# Lith Africa Mental Health App.
#Mobile APP Development Final Project

For my final project, I built the Lith App for the Lith Africa company.
\n
LITH Africa is a start-up that is leveraging intuitive technology for health.
The start-up is currently building products that will change the face of mental health in Africa.
The company aims to provide a centralized platform for solving mental health issues such as major depressive
disorder, anxiety, self-image issues, among other mind health issues. Ultimately,
Lith aims to develop a positive best friend that fits into the hands of the user wherever he/she goes.
